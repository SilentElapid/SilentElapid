### Imagine seeing my profile.

###### So like im a British person that goes by the pronouns he/him and i have no grammar or punctutation ðŸ˜Ž

The languages I primarily use is C++ and the common web langs (HTML, CSS and JS), have some expirience in React.js and Next.js. And I used to think I had decent computer science knowledge until i hit reality. 

I'm allegedly working on multiple things at once.

I'm interested in graphical design and animating even though to say Im terrible at it would be an understatement.

i cannot be bothered to use proper markdown ðŸ˜Ž

~~and finally I used to think Github was an ide~~


best readme on github 100%
